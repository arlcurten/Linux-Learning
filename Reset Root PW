Boot up the machine, and after the BIOS screen, hold down the left Shift key.

Hit the down arrow until you select the 2nd entry from the top 
(the one with the recovery mode in the description) and then hit Enter

You should now see a root prompt, something like this:
root@ubuntu:~#

At this stage you should have a read-only filesystem. You have to remount it with write permissions:
mount -o rw,remount /

Now we can set the user's password with the passwd command. 
(In this example I will use jorge as the example, you need to substitute whatever the user's username is):
root@ubuntu:~# passwd jorge
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
root@ubuntu:~#
